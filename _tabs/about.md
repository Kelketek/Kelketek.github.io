My name is Fox Piacenti. I'm a solutions architect and generalist with a proven history of execution. I have run events and businesses, built web applications, deployed software libraries, written prose and technical articles, produced videos, and more.

This website collects some of my headliner projects over the years. I anticipate adding more content to it as time goes on-- sometimes from my archives and, of course, from whatever new challenge I've taken on.
